# Kommissar

_Kommissar_ Is a lightweight CRM aimed at artists who take commissions.  

## Features

The features to be implemented in first are the tagging system for both clients
and art pieces, which makes you able to see what are the interests of your client, 
as well as being able to establish a list of clients you'd consider "premium",
for whatever reason (but mostly because they pay well and support you).

You'll be able to tag a client as a late payer as well (this is something
the French accounting system allows you to mark as _Doubtful or contentious customers_ in your books.), as well as keeping track of the money they owe you.
