A Nix file is provided to help bootstraping a development environment.
If you are not comfortable with Nix and would rather use it transparently or
not at all, the Makefile provides nix-flavoured of its rules.

* To bootstrap a devleopment environment, execute `$ make bootstrap`;
* To start the project, execute `$ make start`;
* To launch the test suite, execute `$ make test`

If you wish to contribute, here is the guideline:

1. Fork the project;
1. Add your work in a branch;
1. Submit a pull request against `master`

Thank you :)
